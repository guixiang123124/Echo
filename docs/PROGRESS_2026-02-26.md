# Progress — Feb 26

- Fixed code review issues: race conditions, UUID instability, model normalization
- Added API Mode picker (client-direct vs backend-proxy) to iOS Settings UI
- Rewrote keyboard extension `VoiceInputTrigger` for iOS 18+ reliability
- Implemented Volcano embedded encrypted key system (AES-256-GCM + HKDF)
- Verified Railway backend operational, env vars correct
- Dark/light mode adaptive colors fixed
- Deep analysis of streaming pipeline and 5-tier AutoEdit preset system
- Industry comparison: Echo's Stream→Finalize→Polish + confirmDiff review is unique

Key insight: Railway backend Volcano uses batch Flash API, not WebSocket. BackendProxy "streaming" is 750ms HTTP polling.

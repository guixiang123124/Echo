# Progress — Feb 27

## Completed
- Phase 1: DarwinNotificationCenter, AppGroupBridge streaming IPC, ASRProviderResolver, BackgroundDictationService
- Phase 2: BackgroundDictationOverlay, environment object injection, deep link routing
- Phase 3: Keyboard conditional voice button (Darwin toggle vs Link), incremental text injection, heartbeat
- Fixed: AVAudioSession conflict, DerivedData path confusion, overlay not in Xcode project

## Known Bug (Open)
- Second recording fails: first recording works, but re-trigger from keyboard shows UI state but app doesn't actually start recording
- Root cause: AsyncStream single-consumer limitation — need `resetAudioStream()` to create fresh stream per session

## Crisis & Recovery (Evening)
- Session 4 context compaction triggered plan-based rewrite that destroyed 2 days of uncommitted work
- Recovered 22 files from JSONL session transcripts + `@v1` backups
- Fixed post-recovery build errors, deployed to iPhone
- Lesson: **always commit before refactoring**

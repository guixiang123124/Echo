## 2) Problem → Insight
**Section title:** Typing is slow. Pure voice is hard to control.

- Typing gives precision, but low throughput.
- Pure voice gives speed, but poor review/edit control.
- Echo combines both: voice speed + visual editability.

**One-liner:**
Not typing vs voice. Voice input + visual text editing.
